            <h1>Understanding Addition</h1>
            <p>Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total. It's a fundamental arithmetic operation used in everyday life, like managing finances or calculating time. In this section, we'll explore the definition of addition, the addition symbol, parts of addition, and examples.</p>
            
            <h1>What is Addition?</h1>
            <p>Addition is a mathematical operation that combines numbers. The result of an addition is called the sum. For example, when we add 2 and 3 (2 + 3), the sum is 5. Here, we added the two numbers to find the total.</p>
            
            <h1>The Addition Symbol</h1>
            <p>The addition symbol (+) is used to signify that two numbers are being added. In the expression 2 + 3 = 5, the plus sign connects the numbers, showing that they are to be combined to yield the sum.</p>
            
            <h1>Parts of Addition</h1>
            <p>An addition statement consists of the following parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Addends:</strong> The numbers being added together.</li>
                <li><strong>Operator:</strong> The addition symbol (+) used between the addends.</li>
                <li><strong>Sum:</strong> The result obtained from adding the addends.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Addition Formula</h1>
            <p>The addition formula expresses the relationship between the addends and their sum as: addend + addend = sum. For example, in the equation 5 + 6 = 11, 5 and 6 are the addends, and 11 is the sum.</p>

            <h1>Solved Examples of Addition</h1>
            <p>When solving addition problems, you can easily add single-digit numbers. However, for larger numbers, it's helpful to organize them by place value (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). Start adding from the right side (the ones column) and move left. Sometimes you'll encounter carry-overs in your calculations. In the following sections, we'll explore addition with and without regrouping.</p>
