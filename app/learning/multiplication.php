            <h1>Understanding Multiplication</h1>
            <p>Multiplication is the process of combining equal groups of numbers to find their total. It is a fundamental arithmetic operation used in various aspects of daily life, such as calculating areas, determining costs, or analyzing data. In this section, we'll explore the definition of multiplication, the multiplication symbol, parts of multiplication, and examples.</p>
            
            <h1>What is Multiplication?</h1>
            <p>Multiplication is a mathematical operation that combines numbers by adding them repeatedly. The result of a multiplication is called the product. For example, when we multiply 2 and 3 (2 × 3), the product is 6. Here, we are adding the number 2 three times to find the total.</p>
            
            <h1>The Multiplication Symbol</h1>
            <p>The multiplication symbol (×) or an asterisk (*) is used to signify that two numbers are being multiplied. In the expression 2 × 3 = 6, the multiplication sign indicates that 2 is being combined with 3 to yield the product.</p>
            
            <h1>Parts of Multiplication</h1>
            <p>A multiplication statement consists of the following parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Factors:</strong> The numbers being multiplied together.</li>
                <li><strong>Operator:</strong> The multiplication symbol (× or *) used between the factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Product:</strong> The result obtained from multiplying the factors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Multiplication Formula</h1>
            <p>The multiplication formula expresses the relationship between the factors and their product as: factor × factor = product. For example, in the equation 5 × 6 = 30, 5 and 6 are the factors, and 30 is the product.</p>

            <h1>Solved Examples of Multiplication</h1>
            <p>When solving multiplication problems, you can easily multiply single-digit numbers. For larger numbers, it's helpful to organize them using methods like grid multiplication or the traditional algorithm. In the following sections, we'll explore multiplication with and without carrying.</p>
